This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .

One handy way to obtain\n * it is to use ES6 `import * as reducers` syntax. The reducers may never return\n * undefined for any action. Instead, they should return their initial state\n * if the state passed to them was undefined, and the current state for any\n * unrecognized action.\n *\n * @returns {Function} A reducer function that invokes every reducer inside the\n * passed object, and builds a state object with the same shape.\n */\nexport default function combineReducers(reducers) {\n  var reducerKeys = Object.keys(reducers);\n  var finalReducers = {};\n  for (var i = 0; i < reducerKeys.length; i++) {\n    var key = reducerKeys[i];\n\n    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n      if (typeof reducers[key] === 'undefined') {\n        warning('No reducer provided for key \"' + key + '\"');\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (typeof reducers[key] === 'function') {\n      finalReducers[key] = reducers[key];\n    }\n  }\n  var finalReducerKeys = Object.keys(finalReducers);\n\n  var unexpectedKeyCache = void 0;\n  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n    unexpectedKeyCache = {};\n  }\n\n  var shapeAssertionError = void 0;\n  try {\n    assertReducerShape(finalReducers);\n  } catch (e) {\n    shapeAssertionError = e;\n  }\n\n  return function combination() {\n    var state = arguments.length > 0 && arguments[0] !== undefined ? arguments[0] : {};\n    var action = arguments[1];\n\n    if (shapeAssertionError) {\n      throw shapeAssertionError;\n    }\n\n    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n      var warningMessage = getUnexpectedStateShapeWarningMessage(state, finalReducers, action, unexpectedKeyCache);\n      if (warningMessage) {\n        warning(warningMessage);\n      }\n    }\n\n    var hasChanged = false;\n    var nextState = {};\n    for (var _i = 0; _i < finalReducerKeys.length; _i++) {\n      var _key = finalReducerKeys[_i];\n      var reducer = finalReducers[_key];\n      var previousStateForKey = state[_key];\n      var nextStateForKey = reducer(previousStateForKey, action);\n      if (typeof nextStateForKey === 'undefined') {\n        var errorMessage = getUndefinedStateErrorMessage(_key, action);\n        throw new Error(errorMessage);\n      }\n      nextState[_key] = nextStateForKey;\n      hasChanged = hasChanged || nextStateForKey !== previousStateForKey;\n    }\n    return hasChanged ? nextState : state;\n  };\n}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/redux/es/combineReducers.js\n// module id = 749\n// module chunks = 1","'use strict';\nmodule.exports = function (str) {\n\treturn encodeURIComponent(str).replace(/[!'()*]/g, function (c) {\n\t\treturn '%' + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16).toUpperCase();\n\t});\n};\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/strict-uri-encode/index.js\n// module id = 752\n// module chunks = 1","module.exports = require('./lib/index');\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/symbol-observable/index.js\n// module id = 756\n// module chunks = 1","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\n\nvar _ponyfill = require('./ponyfill');\n\nvar _ponyfill2 = _interopRequireDefault(_ponyfill);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { 'default': obj }; }\n\nvar root; /* global window */\n\n\nif (typeof self !== 'undefined') {\n  root = self;\n} else if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n  root = window;\n} else if (typeof global !== 'undefined') {\n  root = global;\n} else if (typeof module !== 'undefined') {\n  root = module;\n} else {\n  root = Function('return this')();\n}\n\nvar result = (0, _ponyfill2['default'])(root);\nexports['default'] = result;\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/symbol-observable/lib/index.js\n// module id = 757\n// module chunks = 1","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\tvalue: true\n});\nexports['default'] = symbolObservablePonyfill;\nfunction symbolObservablePonyfill(root) {\n\tvar result;\n\tvar _Symbol = root.Symbol;\n\n\tif (typeof _Symbol === 'function') {\n\t\tif (_Symbol.observable) {\n\t\t\tresult = _Symbol.observable;\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tresult = _Symbol('observable');\n\t\t\t_Symbol.observable = result;\n\t\t}\n\t} else {\n\t\tresult = '@@observable';\n\t}\n\n\treturn result;\n};\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/symbol-observable/lib/ponyfill.js\n// module id = 758\n// module chunks = 1"],"sourceRoot":""}
